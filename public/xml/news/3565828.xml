  <short_description>Important information regarding coach travel to Saturday's game away to Southport FC</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[The supporters club had tried to book a second coach to make the trip to Haig Avenue this Saturday for the Daggers' trip to Southport FC.
<br  /><br  />
Unfortunately there was not enough numbers for a second coach to be booked, we would like to apologise to anybody that was on the waiting list for the trip that we are unable to book them a place on a coach for this game.
<br  /><br  />
If there is anybody travelling to Southport on Saturday by car that would be interested in potentially transporting any Daggers fans to and from the game, please contact Russell Elmes on 07989 901686.
