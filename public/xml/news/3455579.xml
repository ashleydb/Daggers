  <short_description>Darren Currie gives Daggers player an exclusive interview about the teams performance last night in the Essex Senior Cup</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[“I thought the majority of the younger players done very well in the second half, we tried to play a system in the first half that we didn’t quite get the grip of. In the second half we went back to what is currently running through the first team and academy side at the moment and we looked more of a threat there was no doubt about that.”
<br  /><br  />
“All credit to their keeper who pulled off some great saves in the second half, it feels like I am doing a first team interview as we are creating the chances and we did have enough to get back in the game. The Learning Curve for the players comes from making mistakes in the first half that gave the opposition the lead and then it was difficult to get back into the game. It is disappointing for the younger players because progressing could have gave them another game to gain valuable experience against a senior team.”
<br  /><br  />
“Liam Gordon has been getting some very good reports from the youth team and has had the opportunity to train with the first team in which he holds his own very well. Joe White as we know is in and around the first team at the moment, he’s progressing very well and he’s shown tonight that he is a very intelligent striker.”
<br  /><br  />
"The more experienced players on the pitch such as Barnwell, Heard, Donnellan and Cousins it is about clocking up game time to keep match fit, I think it has shown tonight that they have not played a lot of football. If I’m being honest I was quite disappointed with their performance tonight, except Cousins he done as much as he could do, whenever he fills in he does brilliant. The other three though have got to do better than what they have shown tonight if they are going to make an impact around the first team.”
<br  /><br  />
“For Saturday ideally we’d like to make the odd change, but that will come down to the size of the squad we are working with, which has been the same story for the past 6 or 7 weeks now. Ideally we would like to make 1 or 2 changes to the side, to give certain players another days rest and certainly the way some of the younger players have played tonight they may have given themselves a chance to be in and around it on Saturday.”
