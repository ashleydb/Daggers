  <short_description>Darren Currie gives his thoughts on the Daggers' win over Braintree Town on Monday, the first win at home in six games</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA["We are obviously pleased, we scored three goals and got a clean sheet and overall we showed a very good performance with the confidence and belief that we haven’t quite had of late.
<br  /><br  />
Joe Widdowson was outstanding last night and he had a very good game defensively and also his contribution going forward was important.
<br  /><br  />
We had a young back four and Joe was the old head in the back four, but I thought the back fur as a whole played very well.
<br  />
 
<br  />
With Shaun Donnellan, we had spoken to West Brom and that think very highly of him, we knew that he was a good athlete and as you could see last night, he was very composed on the ball and good in the air.
<br  /><br  />
I thought that Luke Guttridge was also excellent last night and he helped us control the game. With him, Boucaud and Raymond in midfield that helped us to dominate the middle of the pitch and to be able to get the result.
<br  /><br  />
After the game you could sense the confidence in the dressing room that has come back and I believe that we are ready to kick on again now.
<br  /><br  />
Over the last six to seven weeks we have been carrying some big injuries and we have managed to hang on near the top which was the target, so now we have got to believe that we can do something special this year."
