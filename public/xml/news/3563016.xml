  <short_description>Thinking of travelling to Haig Avenue for the Daggers’ fixture against Southport, below is all the information you need to get there by car, train or coach</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[<strong >TRAVELLING BY CAR:</strong><br  />
Leave the M6 at Junction 26 and take the M58 towards Southport. Leave the M58 at Junction 3 and take the A570 towards Ormskirk. From here, follow the A570 around Ormskirk Town Centre and on towards Southport. Upon entering Southport you will come across a large roundabout with Tesco and McDonalds outlets. Take the 3rd exit onto Scarisbeck New Road (A570). You should now be able to make out the ground on your right hand side. Continue past the Richmond Pub on your left and turn right into Haig Avenue where the ground is located further down on the right. There are extremely limited car parking facilities at the ground although street parking is readily available, but watch out for parking restrictions!
<br  /><br  /><strong >BY TRAIN:</strong><br  />
Southport station is accessible from London Euston via two changes enroute. The first part of your journey will take you from Euston to Crewe where you should then go from Crewe to Liverpool South Parkway before completing the journey from South Parkway to Southport. Return journeys require you to travel to Liverpool Central, then to Lime Street before catching a Virgin Trains service to London Euston. The journey takes around three and a half hours each way and is priced at £71.10 for an adult return ticket without a railcard. Southport station is just over a mile from the ground and a taxi should cost around £5.
<br  /><br  /><strong >SUPPORTERS’ COACH:</strong><br  />
The Dagenham &amp; Redbridge Supporters’ Club will also be running a coach to this match at a price of £23 for members and £28 for non-members. It will depart Victoria Road at 8am sharp and contain a 45 minute service stop en-route. Supporters wishing to secure their place on the coach should call 07989901686. Bookings can be taken as late as one day prior to travel, but the later you leave it, the less chance you have of securing your spot on the coach.
