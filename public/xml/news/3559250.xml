  <short_description>Manager John Still gives his reaction to Saturday's last minute win over Chester FC</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[<div ><div>John Still was delighted that that the players never gave up on getting the win against Chester on Saturday.</div><div><br /></div><div><em>"On Saturday if I am being honest I don’t think we played very well but the best teams will find a way of winning those types of games and we found a way to win the game against Chester. That is a testament to the players as maybe a few months ago we wouldn’t have been able to win that game as we wouldn’t have been able to bring on the types of players that we were able to bring on; on Saturday."</em></div><div><em><br /></em></div><div>John says that he knew it would be a tough fixture after their performance against Dover Athletic the weekend before.</div><div><br /></div><div><em>"We scored a goal just before half time and they got a goal just after half time and got another when there was a miss-communication with thinking that the ball had gone off the pitch but I am not going to blame the players for that. Chester kept the ball in play and scored a good goal, and they had a very good go in the game, last week against Dover they lost the game and they didn’t deserve to as they were much the better team in that game so we knew that they would make it difficult for us, which they did."</em></div><div><em><br /></em></div><div>The manager was happy that the players on the bench were able to make a big impact when they came on to help get the win.</div><div><br /></div><div><em>"You need players that are on the bench to be able to come on and take their opportunity when it comes along. It was the same team that started against Tranmere that started on Saturday with the same bench as well as the players that did not start against Tranmere played in a friendly at Gillingham and everyone in the team has pulled their weight and I am really happy with that.</em><em>All the players made an impact when they came on and I am delighted with that and I am happy to get the win, I was not happy with the performance but the players found a way to get the win."</em></div></div><div ><br /></div><div ><strong>Daggers Player HD subscribers can watch the full interview <a href="http://www.player.daggers.co.uk/latest-news">here</a></strong><div><div class="copy-paste-block"><strong>Not a subscriber?
