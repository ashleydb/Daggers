  <short_description>Defender Craig Robson on the win over North Ferriby United on Saturday and his return after being injured </short_description>
  <description><![CDATA["Saturday’s game was a good game to come back to make my first start since getting injured, North Ferriby have been struggling in recent weeks but I’m just happy that we won the game and hopefully we can carry this on and come the end of the season we can be in and about the top spot.
<br  /><br  />
The reason I was out was because I had an MCL (medial collateral ligament) injury, I had a tear which put me out for about 8 weeks. The injury unfortunately took a little longer to heal, then it was just about trying to get fit again which felt like a very long process but I’m back and fit now.
<br  /><br  />
There was a stage earlier in the season where we were struggling to fill the centre half position and it was frustrating as you don’t want to see the squads top goal scorer have to drop back and play in that position, even though I think he did do a very good job. We did drop points against some teams that we should be beating unfortunately but that happens and we’ve learnt from that.
<br  /><br  />
We are not in this league to sit in mid table, we want to go up and the belief is there throughout the team. With players returning from injuries the team is only going to get stronger with the competition for places, if we can keep getting results then there’s no reason we can’t get promoted."
