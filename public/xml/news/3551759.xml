  <short_description>If you are unable to make it to this Saturday's home fixture against Chester FC, tune in to Daggers Player to join James Glass for live commentary and updates from the Chigwell Construction Stadium</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[The old saying that “three’s a crowd” will be put to the test on Saturday. As the Daggers welcome mid table Chester City to East London I will be joined by not one but two fellow commentators. Mick Payne back from another bout of travelling the country to scout for the England C team will be taking up his usual seat to provide insight and analysis.
<br  /><br  />
We will be joined by Martin Smith who is travelling from Bournemouth to cast his eye over both teams. Martin who like Mick and myself is a qualified coach will join us to discuss coaching abroad and the challenges for young coaches coming through the ranks.
<br  /><br  />
It all means Ned Keating who made the long journey for the memorable trip to Tranmere can focus on his written article, but will be sorely missed after kindly agreeing to help out last week. I will keep a close eye out for any ‘Gnarly’ tackles in recognition of his work.
<br  /><br  />
The Daggers are on a three game winning streak without conceding, averaging three goals a game and Saturday promises to be another exciting fixture.
<br  /><br  />
Live coverage will begin at 2.40pm where we will announce the teams and discuss coaching in the modern world. Full uninterrupted match commentary will follow.
<br  /><br  />
Advanced notice that at present we will not be able to make the trip to Southport but check the website for more information.
<br  /><br  />
