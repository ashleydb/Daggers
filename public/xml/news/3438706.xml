  <short_description>Defender Josh Staunton gives his thoughts on the defeat to Barrow on Saturday.</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[<div >"We know that we were below par against Barrow on Saturday, it was a case of mistakes in both boxes unfortunately and we made mistakes in our defensive unit which can always cost you."</div><div ><br /></div><div >"When we had our chances upfront it just wasn’t our day as the goalkeeper made three or four good saves and we had miss-hit shots, which is disappointing for us."</div><div ><br /></div><div >"Magnus Okuonghae has been training with us for a while now to keep himself fit and he is an experienced defender and we have built up a good relationship, but we hadn’t played together before."</div><div ><br /></div><div >"It is good for us that Forest Green lost as they were unable to make any more ground on us as we don’t want to keep climbing back, we want to beat the teams that are in an around us in the table because we don’t want any teams pulling away from us."</div><div ><br /></div><div >"But we will concentrate on ourselves and we know that we need to hit some consistency in our results as we want to be successful this season."</div><div ><br /></div><div >"We need to be harder to beat, even if we get a draw as at the end of the season you can look at certain points that you have picked up and think that was an important point. Unfortunately after Saturday we go home with nothing and we just want to make things right against Torquay on Tuesday."</div><div ><br /></div><div ><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Daggers Player HD subscribers can watch the full interview <a href="http://www.player.daggers.co.uk/latest-news">here</a></strong></p><div><div class="copy-paste-block"><strong>Not a subscriber?
