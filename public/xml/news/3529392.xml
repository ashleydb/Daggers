  <short_description>The Daggers are delighted to announce the permanent signing of winger Jake Howells and youth loan signing of defender Jake Sheppard. </short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[Midfielder Jake Howells who has signed a deal with the Daggers until June 30th 2018, worked his way through the ranks at Luton Town and made his first-team debut on the final day of the 2007/08 season against Huddersfield Town.
<br  />
 
<br  />
A regular in the Hatters side that went on to lift the Football League Trophy at Wembley the following season, he won the club's Young Player of the Season award and he repeated the feat the following two seasons.
<br  /><br  />
When John Still took over as Luton Manager, it was Howells who scored the first goal under his reign in a 1–0 win away to Stockport County and was a virtual ever-present the following season as The Kenilworth Road side won the National League title.
<br  /><br  />
He had a loan spell at Yeovil in 2015 before returning to Luton and, after adding a further 14 appearances, totalled 334 appearances and 31 goals for the Hatters.
<br  /><br  />
His contract was not renewed by Luton and he signed for National League club Eastleigh on a two-year contract, making his debut on the opening day of the season in a 2-1 win at home to Guiseley. His contract was terminated by Eastleigh on 4th January 2017, when manager Martin Allen began reshaping the squad, and John Still was quick to sign the left winger.
<br  /><br  />
Jake has played international football for Wales at Under-21 level and for England at C team level.
<br  />
 
<br  />
Defender Jake Sheppard has joined the Daggers from Reading FC on a youth loan until the end of the 2016/2017 season.
<br  />
 
<br  />
The young full back signed a professional contract with Reading in July 2015 although he has yet to make a senior appearance for the club.
<br  />
 
<br  />
The Defender has had short loan spells at Hayes &amp; Yeading and Eastbourne, and featured in the FA Youth Cup last season for Reading against Arsenal.
<br  />
 
<br  />
Jake Howells will be squad number 29 and Jake Sheppard will wear number 28 for the Daggers.
