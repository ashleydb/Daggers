  <short_description>After Tuesday's Emirates FA Cup fixture against FC Halifax Town the club appealed Oliver Hawkins' red card</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[After the incident which earned Oliver Hawkins a red card for handball, the club have appealed the decision.
<br  /><br  />
We're pleased to report the club have been successful with the appeal and the red card has been rescinded. Therefore he will be available for Saturday's away National League fixture against York City.
<br  /><br  />
We spoke to Dagger's Manager John Still to hear his views of the incident:
<br  /><br  />
"Seeing the incident live, I did go in to speak to the referee, officials and assessor after the game and gave my view. Viewing the footage back only confirmed what we thought that it wasnâ€™t a penalty or a sending off offence, which has proved to be the case."
<br  /><br  />
"With the news of Oliver Hawkins' suspension being rescinded he will be in our squad and available for selection on Saturday for our away game against York City"
