  <short_description>Thinking of travelling to Sincil Bank for the Daggers’ fixture against Lincoln City, below is all the information you need to get there by car, train or coach</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[<div ><strong>DIRECTIONS BY CAR:</strong></div><div >Take the A1 and continue on until the A46 exit towards the A17/Sleaford/Lincoln/Newark. At the roundabout, take the first exit onto the A46. Follow this road into Lincoln and it will eventually lead onto the High Road where the ground is well signposted for ease of access. In terms of parking,if you follow the sign that reads ‘away coaches’, you will be led onto the A158 South Park Avenue, where there is plenty of street parking to be found. This is, however, a ten minute walk from the ground. Alternatively, parking is available at £4 per vehicle directly behind the Stacey West Stand at the stadium.</div><div ><br /></div><div ><strong>BY TRAIN:</strong></div><div >With this fixture being moved to a Monday night the last train back to London departs Lincoln Central at 21:40, making a one-day trip almost impossible. On the way up however, the 15:30 from Kings Cross to Lincoln is priced at £34 and requires one change at Peterborough before arriving in Lincoln at 17:50. A super off-peak single on the Tuesday from Lincoln to London is priced at £43, bringing a total cost of £77. From the station, the football ground is around a 15 minute walk away. Turn right out of the station and follow the road to the bridge located around 30-yards down. Cross the bridge and once over, follow the road straight down to the ground.</div><div ><br /></div><div ><strong>SUPPORTERS’ COACH:</strong></div><div >The Dagenham &amp; Redbridge Supporters’ Club will be running a coach to this fixture at a price of £10 for members, £15 for non-members and £10 for those under-16. The coach will depart Victoria Road at 2:30pm with a 45 minute service stop en-route. If you are planning to take the coach to this fixture, please call Russell Elmes on the DRFC Travel Hotline using 07989901686.</div><div ><br /></div><div >Ticket information for the game can be found <a href="http://www.daggers.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/tickets-lincoln-city-v-dagenham-and-redbridge-3639833.aspx">here</a>. </div>]]></description>
