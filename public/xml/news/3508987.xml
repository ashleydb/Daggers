  <short_description>Rampant Daggers Thump Northampton for 7 </short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[Daggers U18s kicked off 2017 in empathic form thumping Northampton 7-2. The Daggers played with poise, control and movement as they erased the memory of the last performance in 2016. They returned showing the quality of football and clinical finishing, that has seen previous teams this season fall victims. Daggers took hold of the contest from the start and refused to let their opponents get into the game.
<br  /><br  />
Jordy Mongoy opening the score, slotting in from close range after a flowing move. The hosts then equalised against the run of play, the response from Daggers was ruthless. Attack after attack rained on the hosts, there bar being rattled 3 times in first half alone. Jordy Mongoy helped himself to another to register his brace, Dylan Florence also got a brace, and  Elliot Bonds, Harvey Brown and Mustaphe Ali registered their name on the score sheet. The host managed to pull another back  amoungst the Daggers goals, but they were well beaten and never looked like they was going to upset the rampant daggers.
<br  /><br  />
Academy Manager Micah Hyde's thoughts on the game;
<br  /><br  />
“They played very well and converted the chances their dominance in possession gave them. Individually they showed good game understanding of their role and the quality and intensity required to execute it. They were very disappointed in their last performance, and responded in the right way”.
<br  /><br  />
“Played football the way we would like and controlling the game, which is good. It would have been a  perfect performance, if there is such a thing, if we had kept a clean sheet. But we do not seek perfection, but consistency and they continue to show positive signs of understanding that”, continued a pleased Hyde.
