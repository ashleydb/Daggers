  <short_description>Dagenham &amp; Redbridge left it late to record a vital 1-0 win at home to York City in the National League</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[Daggers made six changes for the clash, with Curtley Williams, Josh Staunton, Luke Guttridge, Luke Howell, Elliott Romain and Paul Benson coming in to the starting XI.
<br  /><br  />
There was also a start for skipper Scott Doe, who was making his 300th appearance for Daggers.
<br  /><br  />
In the seventh minute, Benson had a header saved following a good ball into the box from full-back Joe Widdowson.
<br  /><br  />
Two minutes later, Benson saw a header cleared off the line following a corner from Guttridge.
<br  /><br  />
York, though, created several chances themselves with Jon Parkin, Adriano Moke and Amari Morgan-Smith all going close in a first half which ended goalless.
<br  /><br  />
Corey Whitely missed a good chance for Daggers in the 58th minute, unable to get a clean connection on the ball after a great cross from Romain.
<br  /><br  />
In the 72nd minute, Romain was unable to head home his first goal for the club after a superb cross from Williams.
<br  /><br  />
At the other end seven minutes later, Elliot Justham was tested by a venoumous half-volley from Asa Hall.
<br  /><br  />
With seven minutes remaining, Daggers took the lead with a great, curled effort from the edge of the area by substitute Frankie Raymond.
<br  /><br  />
It proved to be the gameâ€™s only goal as Daggers returned to winning ways in front of their home fans.
