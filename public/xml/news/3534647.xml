  <short_description>After Saturday’s postponement here at The Chigwell Construction Stadium our game against Bromley has been rescheduled to Tuesday 21st February, 7:45pm KO.</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[A new date has been arranged to play the local derby against Bromley, which was cancelled last Saturday. The game will now be played on Tuesday 21st February, 7:45pm KO.
<br  /><br  />
We would again like to take this opportunity to apologise to both home and away supporters for Saturday’s postponement, especially those who felt 12:30pm was slightly late. However the referee wanted to leave the decision as late as possible in an effort to give the ground staff the best opportunity to get the match playable. He was able to do this due to the relatively short distance between the clubs. Obviously an earlier decision would have been sought had the opposition been travelling a longer distance.
