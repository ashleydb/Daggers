  <short_description>Thinking of Travelling to the New Lawn Stadium for the Daggers’ fixture against Forest Green Rovers, below is all the information you need to get there by car, train or coach.</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[<strong >DIRECTIONS BY CAR:</strong><br  />
Take the M5 and exit at Junction 13, heading for Stroud on the A419. At Stroud, turn on to the A46 towards Nailsworth. This will bring you out towards the centre of the town, and when you reach the Information Centre take the first right at the mini-roundabout which goes up a steep hill signposted Forest Green. The New Lawn is located at the top of this hill. If you are relying on a
<br  />
road-map for your journey, make sure you search for Nailsworth rather than Forest Green itself. There is a carpark available at the stadium which has capacity for 250 vehicles at a cost of £3 per car.
<br  /><br  /><strong >BY TRAIN:</strong><br  />
There is no railway station in Nailsworth or Forest Green, so travelling from London you have to take a train from London Paddington to Stroud, which is located around three miles away from the New Lawn. The journey is either direct or via a change at Swindon. It will take around 90 minutes and is priced at £27.50 for an adult return ticket without a railcard. Given the distance from the station to the football ground, it is best advised that supporters order a taxi before and after the game. Alternatively, Stagecoach bus numbers 93 and 46 both operate between Stroud and Nailsworth; ask the driver to drop you at Beechwood Close which is a four minute walk from the stadium.
<br  /><br  /><strong >SUPPORTERS COACH:</strong><br  />
The supporters club will be running a coach to this fixture at a cost of £18 for members and £23 for non-members. It will depart Victoria Road at 10:30am and will not be making a service stop enroute.
<br  />
Supporters are advised that due to the good form of the team on the pitch coach spaces are filling up fast, so book today to avoid disappointment!
