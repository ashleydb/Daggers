  <description><![CDATA[The Daggers can announce that Defender Sam Ling has extended his contract with the club until the end of the current season.
<br  /><br  />
The defender has made nine appearances for the club since signing on a short term deal in September.
<br  /><br  />
Manager John Still is delighted that Sam Ling has signed until the end of the season:
<br  /><br  />
"I am delighted that Sam has signed until the end of the season. He has had a few injuries this season unfortunately which has hampered him from playing regularly.
<br  /><br  />
Sam is a young lad that we like and he has done really well when he has played, so we are all happy that he is with us until the end of the season"
