  <short_description>Mideiflder Scott Heard on signing for Dagenham and Redbridge and making his debut for the club on Tuesday against Aldershot Town. </short_description>
  <description><![CDATA["It was a really tough game on Tuesday, especially coming on as a sub for my debut, as it was quite late on the game but the manager told me to just stay calm and get into the positions where I can be effective."
<br  /><br  />
"I wanted to defend from the font foot, and the manager showed great faith in me to put me on when I only signed last week, so I was really buzzing to get on in the game."
<br  /><br  />
"Playing alongside players like Boucaud and Robinson and even training with them you can see the experience and skill that they have, and I just want to learn of these players."
<br  /><br  />
"I really want to improve and I feel that I am still young enough to improve my game, and I am thankful for the chance that the manager and the club have put in me and want to repay that faith when I am on the pitch."
<br  /><br  />
"Looking ahead to Saturdayâ€™s game we have just got to play our own game and to our strengths which will help us to get a result."
