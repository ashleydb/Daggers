  <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1" >A priceless late header from skipper Scott Doe gave Daggers the victory that keeps their promotion bid on track.</p><p class="p2" >Doe powered home a header from Frankie Raymond's brilliant free kick with just two minutes of normal time remaining.</p><p class="p2" >It was no more than the Daggers deserved after a vibrant display that made nonsense of earlier performances that brought home defeats against strugglers Guiseley and Maidstone.  </p><p class="p2" >They have been at their best against the top teams this season. And this no exception as they went into the match boosted by the news that manager John Still had signed a new two year contract.</p><p class="p2" >The Daggers were at it from the start against opponents who also have their eye on promotion.  </p><p class="p2" >Corey Whitely, back in the team after serving a three match ban, whipped in a wicked cross from the right that passed across the face of goal with no one up to apply the finishing touch.</p><p class="p2" >Oliver Hawkins put a header over from a Jordan Maguire-Drew ball. But the Daggers were not having things all their own way in a competitive, entertaining match and Doe was on hand to clear off the line when a slip let Rovers in.</p><p class="p2" >But the Daggers broke the deadlock in the 53rd minute - the first  time they had been in the lead for six matches.</p><p class="p2" >Maguire-Drew  was the man of the moment, turning the ball in from close range after Fejiri Okenabirhie broke down the  left and delivered a fine cross.</p><p class="p2" >Forest Green had no intention of lying down and they equalised ten minutes from time through a fine header from former Dagger Christian Doidge, who quit the club last season even though Still wanted to keep him.</p><p class="p2" >It looked then as though the Daggers would have to settle for a point. But Doe had other ideas with the 88th minute goal that capped a  cracking afternoon.</p><p class="p2" >Attendance: 1459 (179 away)</p><p class="p2" >Line Ups:</p><p class="p2" >Daggers: Justham, Widdowson, Doe, Robson, Okenabirhie, Hawkins (Benson 84’), Maguire-Drew (Raymond 78’), Boucaud, Whitely, Donnellan (Staunton 45’), Sheppard</p><p class="p2" >Unused Subs: Cousins, Grant</p><p class="p2" >Forest Green Rovers: Russell, Ellis, Bennett, Doidge, Carter (Bugiel 60’), Woolery, Noble, Pinnock, Wishart (Kelly 60’), Sinclair (Robert 65’), Cooper</p><p class="p2" >Unused Subs: Traore, Wedgbury</p>]]></description>
