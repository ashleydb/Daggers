  <description><![CDATA[The Daggers face another team who are struggling this coming Saturday following on from the successful trip to Southport last time out.
<br  />
 
<br  />
John Still and his side welcome Guiseley AFC to the Chigwell Construction stadium who they beat in the reverse fixture 2-0 back in sunny August, in their annual Daggers Against Racism Day.
<br  /><br  />
The sun is certainly shining for Dagenham since the turn of the year, despite the actual weathers best efforts. Five wins from five games racking up an impressive 16 goals in the process has propelled the Daggers to second in the National League.
<br  /><br  />
2017 is the year of the fire rooster and Saturday provides a good opportunity for the Daggers to extend their winning run before the enforced break, due to the Lincoln game’s postponement. The fire rooster is known for being responsible at work at the team will need to be exactly that on Saturday. Guiseley have lost only once in the last four winning twice and will not be an easy team to break down.
<br  />
 
<br  />
If you can’t make it James Glass will be back at the usual time of 2.40pm after not being able to make the trip to Southport.
<br  /><br  />
James Glass will bring you uninterrupted coverage of the game whilst keeping you up to date with all the goals around the country as they go in.
