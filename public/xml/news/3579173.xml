  <short_description>We spoke to midfielder Andre Boucaud ahead of Saturday's Daggers Against Racism Day fixture against Guiseley AFC</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[Andre Boucaud made his 100th appearance for Dagenham &amp; Redbridge on Saturday for the Daggers’ 4-1 win against Southport.
<br  /><br  /><em >"I’m happy to of reached that landmark with the club and especially it was a great game to reach my 100th appearance for the club. We went up to Southport looking to do a job, it wasn’t the greatest of football matches, but the main thing was to get the three points and we done that."</em><br  /><br  />
This Saturday’s game against Guiseley could give the Daggers an impressive sixth straight win in the league this season, the side have currently not lost a single game in 2017 and have racked up a total of 16 goals to start perfectly in the New Year.
<br  /><br  /><em >"At this stage of the season it’s all about just getting the results and being consistent, the pitches this time of the season are getting pretty hard to play on so it is difficult to play the football we want to play, but again it’s about getting the three points in any way we can."</em><br  /><br  />
The Daggers’ next three games are against Guiseley, Bromley and Maidstone all at the Chigwell Construction Stadium. Although Boucaud does not believe that these games will be any easier than games against promotion contenders.
<br  /><br  /><em >"Just because two of these teams are in the bottom half, I think these games will still be very difficult because teams are fighting for survival, so we’ll have to go in to the game concentrated and focused on getting the three points. Guiseley picked up a win on Tuesday, so Saturday won’t be an easy game, I think it will be harder than a game against a team like Tranmere or Lincoln. The public may think we are going into the game and will win easily compared on the run we are on and the position in the league we are in, but football doesn’t work in that way so we will have to go into the game and focus and concentrate on getting the win."   </em>

This year Andre Boucaud missed a selection of League matches after call ups from his national side Trinidad and Tobago, Andre does not believe this affects the way the team or he plays on the pitch.<em ><br /><br />
"When I go away to play for Trinidad and Tobago some people don’t seem to realise that, I’m not going away on holiday, I’m playing first team competitive football in a World Cup campaign playing against big countries such as USA, Mexico and Costa Rica which have players you would only dream about playing against. When I do go away to these tournaments I’m not losing fitness the only problem that may occur is due to the jetlag and time difference. It’s always been easy to slot back into the side as the players are all doing so well and it’s a great atmosphere at the training ground."
