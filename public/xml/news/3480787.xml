  <short_description>Academy Starlets Lauded For On &amp; Off Pitch Achievements</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[The on and off the pitch achievements of eleven young footballers has been recognised by League Football Education (LFE). ‘The 11’ acknowledges the football and academic progress of Under-18 players on apprenticeships at current or former English Football League clubs - and is also designed to assess other factors such as involvement in community or charity based initiatives.
<br  /><br  />
Judged by LFE’s team of regional officers, this accolade, celebrates the holistic development of young players, a barometer which is also applied to the Apprentice of the Year Awards later in the season. Charlton Athletic starlet, Ademola Lookman, and AFC Bournemouth midfielder Lewis Cook (formerly Leeds United) were both named in ‘The 11’ ahead of becoming the Championship’s Apprentice of the Year, while others to previously feature in this select group include, Dael Fry (Middlesbrough) and Conor Chaplin (Portsmouth).
