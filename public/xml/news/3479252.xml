  <short_description>Thinking of travelling to Cressing Road for the Daggers’ fixture against Braintree Town, below is all the information you need to get there by car, train or coach</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[<strong >Directions by Car:</strong><br  />
Leave the M11 at Junction 8 and take the A120 towards Colchester. Follow this road for 16 miles until you reach the ‘Galley’s Corner’ roundabout with the McDonalds on the right. Fromn here, take the first exit into Cressingb Road. After three-quarters-of-a-mile, turn left into Clockhouse Way – signposted Braintree Town FC – and then take the first left which leads to the stadium itself. There is a small car-park at the ground at a cost of £2 per vehicle, otherwise street parking is also available.
<br  /><br  /><strong >By Train:</strong><br  />
Given the nature of this fixture falling on Boxing Day, train services from Chadwell Heath, Romford or anywhere across the Abellio Greater Anglia Network are completely unavailable. This is due to engineering works.
<br  /><br  /><strong >Supporters Coach:</strong><br  />
The Dagenham &amp; Redbridge Supporters’ Club will be running a coach to this fixture at a cost of £10 for members and £15 for non-members. The coach will depart Victoria Road at 12pm and will not contain a service stop en-route. Given the date of the fixture and the lack of rail options available, it is advised that supporters wishing to book travel for this game do so before Christmas Eve using the Travel hotline number, 07989901686.
