  <short_description>Dagenham &amp; Redbridge lost for the first time in five matches in all competitions after a 5-0 loss at home to Gateshead.</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[Daggers made just the one change, with the Andre Boucaud, who is away on international duty with Trinidad &amp; Tobago, replaced by Sam Ling.
<br  /><br  />
The Essex club almost fell behind in the 12th minute when Heed forward Sam Jones hit the post with an overhead kick.
<br  /><br  />
Jones, however, did find the net eight minutes later when slotting under Daggers stopper Elliot Justham after turning his man 18 yards out.
<br  /><br  />
In the 36th minute, Daggers nearly drew level when Joe Widdowson found Oliver Hawkins with a cross, but the striker’s header was straight at Dan Hanford.
<br  /><br  />
Just two minutes into the second half, Daggers fell further behind when Mitch Brundle’s free-kick beat Justham from 25 yards.
<br  /><br  />
Gateshead added a third in the 60th minute when Jones scored his second of the match from close range.
<br  /><br  />
Two minutes later, Scott Doe was adjudged to have fouled in the box, with Danny Johnson converting the penalty.
<br  /><br  />
And there was a fifth three minutes later as Jamal Fyfield slammed home from close range.
<br  /><br  />
No further goals followed, despite efforts for both sides, as Daggers slipped to just a second home loss of the season.
