  <short_description>Daggers groundsman, Asa Perry, has spoken exclusively to Daggers Player to try and explain some of the problems we are experiencing with the pitch at the moment.</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" >“At the minute we are struggling with chafer grubs, these are little grubs that live under the grass and in the soil.
<br /><br />
They feed off of the root of the grass and that can lead to crows and magpies coming down to dig up the grass looking for the grubs and that is why we currently have some patches on our pitch.
<br /><br />
There was a chemical that could be used to kill the grubs but this was taken of the market by the environmental agency so at the minute there is nothing that can be used to get rid of them.
<br /><br />
We are trying a few different methods to scare them off but at the minute it doesn’t seem to be working.
<br /><br />
We have re-turfed some areas of the pitch and we were set to re-turf another area last Friday but it was too wet for this to go ahead.
<br /><br />
The frost is supposed to kill the grubs so with the frost that we had last night hopefully that has got rid of most of them.
<br /><br />
It is not only us where this has occurred as this has happened to other clubs as well, we are quite lucky that it is only in certain areas of the pitch because some football clubs have had to re-turf their whole pitch.”
