  <description><![CDATA[The Daggers can announce that Scholar Joe White has signed an 18 month pro contract after impressing the Daggers staff throughout his time at the club.
<br  /><br  />
Joe White has featured in the Daggers' first team a number of times this season, with his debut being in the 2-1 defeat in the FA Cup 1st round replay against Halifax Town, when the forward replaced Jordan Maguire-Drew in the 90th minute.
<br  /><br  />
We spoke to Manager John Still about the young scholar signing his pro contract and this is what he had to say:
<br  /><br  />
"We've watched Joe white quite a bit this year and he has done very well, we've been very pleased with his performances and how he conducts himself"
<br  /><br  />
"When he comes into the first team squad he's not looked out of place, although he is still a youth much like Tyrique Hyde we felt it was the right thing to do to include him in with the first team squad"
