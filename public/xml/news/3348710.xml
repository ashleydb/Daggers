  <description><![CDATA[<div >"We went down to ten men, but I think that for a lot of the game we had the ascendancy and carried the game, we just lacked the final pass or cross."</div><div >  </div><div >"I thought that we lacked a little bit of knowledge on what we needed to do, we tried to give information into the players from the side but Scott Doe coming off was a big miss."</div><div > </div><div >"It was at times like this when players like Boucaud and Guttridge are going to be coming into play, and today we didn’t have those two."</div><div ><br /></div><div >"We missed Benson as well as we would have probably brought him on tonight as we needed a little bit of knowledge, which we understand that we don’t have in abundance."</div><div ><br /></div><div >"I don’t think we could have given more as I was pleased with our effort, determination and our quality up until the final third."</div><div > </div><div >"Josh Staunton has come in and played quite a few games and Robson had done nothing wrong when he had played and he has had a good season so far.
