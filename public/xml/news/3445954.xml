  <short_description>An away guide for the Dagger's Vanarama National League away tie at Dover Athletic on Saturday. </short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[The home of Dover Athletic since 1931, the Crabble Athletic Ground has a capacity of 5,745 and is the thirteenth largest ground in the National League.
<br  /><br  />
Although comprised predominantly of terracing, the Crabble has undergone significant redevelopment over the close season which has seen the Family Stand rebuilt to accommodate 500 supporters and the construction of new changing room facilities. The Dover End and the River End both remain terraced, although the Dover End is newly segregated in preparation for a potential push towards the Football League. The Crabble, synonymous for its sloping pitch, is completed by the Main Stand which houses four rows of seats and a curious portakabin arrangement which works as the Directors Lounge.
<br  /><br  /><strong >DAGGERS FANS:</strong><br  />
Although segregation is not generally enforced at Dover, in the event this match is a segregated fixture Daggers fans will be housed in a section of the covered Dover End Terrace. This stand can accommodate 2,000 supporters in total and offers excellent views of the countryside, although Daggers fans are advised to wrap-up given the exposed nature of the ground. Food is available inside the stadium at a reasonable price, with hot dogs at £2.80 and burgers at £3.20.
<br  /><br  /><strong >FOOD &amp; DRINK:</strong><br  />
The Crabble Ground is located in a highly residential area, and as such there is not a lot in the way of takeaways and restaurants. For any pre-match food, your best bet is to head into Dover Town Centre which is around a 5-10 minute walk from Dover Priory Station, and 30 minutes from the ground. Pub selection is also limited to the ‘Cricketers’ on Crabble Road, or the ‘Railway Bell’ and ‘Dublin Man O’War’ near Kearnsey Station. Again, Dover Town Centre offers more variety, including the ‘Eight Bells’ on Cannon Street which is a JD Wetherspoon outlet listed in the CAMRA Good Beer Guide.
