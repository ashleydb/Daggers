  <short_description>Important information regarding the Traditional Builders Stand for the home game against York City on Saturday 25th March</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[The Manager and Board appreciate the enthusiasm and noise in support of the team generated from the home fans within the Traditional Builder Stand this season. The club have, however, become concerned at the behaviour of a small number of supporters in that Stand.
<br  /><br  />
We have even been asked by some of the people who regularly use the area why we have allowed the behaviour to continue after a previous website comment.
<br  /><br  />
With just 5 home games remaining we have the potential to have some “big matches” in terms of the importance to the club in our challenge for promotion. We want to ensure that the support for the team continues, but behaviour off the pitch doesn’t detract from the performance of the team on it.
<br  /><br  />
For the next game, against Forest Green, home and away supporters will be allowed to share the facilities. This top of the table clash gives both sets of supporters the chance to show that they can watch a game without resorting to the foul language, gesturing and intimidation that has been present at recent games. There will be additional stewards on duty at the game, and they will be tasked with monitoring behaviour and speaking with spectators as appropriate.
<br  /><br  />
However, we must advise that, following a review the subject of crowd behaviour at our most recent Safety Advisory Group meeting, for the game against York City on 25th March home supporters will not be allowed to use that stand. Season ticket holders will be contacted individually with regard to alternative seats in the ground.
<br  /><br  />
There is an expectation that the club will continually monitor things as the season progresses and consider whether sharing the stand and its facilities can be allowed at each of the games that follow. So please understand why stewards are more visible and active in speaking to fans, and help us to ensure the season ends on as positive a note off the field as we hope it will on.
