  <short_description>Thinking of travelling to Holker Street for the Daggers’ fixture against Barrow AFC, below is all the information you need to get there by car, train or coach</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[<strong >DIRECTIONS BY CAR:</strong><br  />
Leave the M6 at Junction 36 and take the A590 towards Barrow-in-Furness. As you enter the outskirts of Barrow, you will pass a fire station on your right hand side. From here, you should be able to see the floodlights of the stadium on your left. Turn left into Wilkie Road and then right into Holker Street. Plenty of street parking is available.
<br  /><br  /><strong >BY TRAIN:</strong><br  />
Barrow-in-Furness Railway Station is not served directly by trains from London Euston, but is accessible via a change at Lancaster Station. This journey takes around three hours, and if you split your fare into two return journeys from Euston-Lancaster and Lancaster-Barrow, you can save L4 on a total fare of L68. This is for adult tickets without a railcard. Holker Street is around a one mile walk from Barrow-in-Furness Station. Exit the station onto the small entrance road which leads directly to the football ground.
<br  /><br  /><strong >SUPPORTERS COACH:</strong><br  />
The Dagenham &amp; Redbridge Supporters’ Club will be running a coach to this fixture at a price of £20 for members and £25 for non-members. The coach will depart Victoria Road at 6:30am with a 45 minute service stop en-route. If you are planning to take the coach to this fixture, please call Russell Elmes on the DRFC Travel Hotline using 07989901686.
