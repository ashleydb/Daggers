  <short_description>Midfielder Frankie Raymond talks about last Saturday's win away to Tranmere Rovers and Saturday's home fixture against Chester FC</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[Frankie Raymond thought that last weekend’s trip to Prenton Park was one of best results of the season after the Daggers beat promotion rivals Tranmere 2-0.
<br  /><br  /><em >“Saturday’s game against Tranmere was a great win and probably one of our best wins away from home this season, we showed a lot of character and it was a massive win against a main rival for us.”
<br /><br />
“We know that in this league we are as good as anybody and Saturday’s result shows that, to go to Tranmere, who have the best defensive record in the league especially at home, and be able to come away with the three points was a brilliant result.”
<br /></em><br  />
With the Daggers squad seeing the return of injured players such as midfielder Luke Howell coming off the bench on Saturday to see his first league action since early October; the competion for places is now stronger than ever.   
<br  /><br  /><em >“We have a very strong squad together now after the injuries that we had in the last few months so we have lots of options to pick from now for the manager and we are in a very strong position going into the last few months of the season.”</em><br  /><br  />
After Saturday’s game away to Tranmere the Daggers have now gone 3 games without conceding a single goal and racking up a total of nine goals in the three games to start the year.
<br  /><br  /><em >“We have got some really tough games to come before the end of the season, but I think that the Tranmere result shows that we have no one to fear in this league as we believe in ourselves and we just need to concentrate on ourselves.”
<br /><br />
“The most pleasing thing for us is that we have got three clean sheets in a row now and have managed to get nine goals as well so keeping the clean sheets gives us a platform for our attackers to go and enjoy themselves.”
<br /><br />
“Chester beat us quite easily at the start of the season when we were a new team together, but we have bedded in since then and we hope to get the three points over them this weekend.”</em><br  /><strong ><br />
