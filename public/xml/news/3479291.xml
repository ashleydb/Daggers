  <short_description>An away guide for the Dagger's Vanarama National League away tie at Braintree Town on Boxing Day</short_description>
  <description><![CDATA[The home of Braintree Town, Cressing Road has a total capacity of 4,145 and is the sixth smallest ground in the National League.
<br  /><br  />
The stadium has undergone various renovations in the past decade, including the construction of two new, modern terraces at either end of the pitch. These terraces are both completely uncovered, and are both within touching distance of the goal-nets. The ground is completed by a further covered terrace running the length of the pitch and a seated stand with a capacity to hold 553 supporters. Adjacent to this are two extra terrace areas, both of which are completely uncovered.
<br  /><br  /><strong >Daggers Fans:</strong><br  />
Away supporters are housed in the Quag End which has a capacity of 1,000 and is completely uncovered. It was renovated in 2012 and despite containing a cover prior to redevelopment, it is now open to the elements. Alternatively, Daggers fans have been allocated a small number of seats in the totally covered main stand.
<br  /><br  /><strong >Food &amp; Drink:</strong><br  />
There is a good size clubhouse at the ground, however, this is not available to away supporters if segregation is enforced. A five minute walk away is the Orange Tree Pub on Clockhouse Way, while the Picture Palace is a JD Wetherspoons outlet on Fairfield Road which is a five minute walk from Braintree Station. This pub is a converted cinema and is also listed in the CAMRA Good Beer Guide. In terms of food, the Galleyâ€™s Corner roundabout has a number of fast food restaurants, while Manor Street, also five minutes from the station, and contains a number of eating establishments.
